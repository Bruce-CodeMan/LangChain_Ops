1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We started OpenAI seven years ago because we felt like something really interesting was happening in AI.
2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We wanted to help steer it in a positive direction.
3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's honestly just really amazing to see how far this whole field has come since then.
4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And it's really gratifying to hear from people like Raymond who are using the technology we are building in others for so many wonderful things.
5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We hear from people who are excited, we hear from people who are concerned, we hear from people who feel both those emotions at once.
6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And honestly that's how we feel.
7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Above all, it feels like we're entering an historic period right now where we as a world are going to define a technology that will be so important for our society going forward.
8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And I believe that we can manage this for good.
9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So today I want to show you the current state of that technology and some of the underlying design principles that we hold dear.
10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So the first thing I'm going to show you is what it's like to build a tool for an AI rather than building it for a human.
11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So we have a new dolly model which generates images and we are exposing it as an app for chatGPT to use on your behalf.
12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And you can do things like ask, you know, suggest a nice post-ted meal and draw a picture of it.
13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now you get all of the sort of ideation and creative back and forth and taking care of the details for you that you get out of chatGPT.
14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And here we go, it's not just the idea for the meal but very, very detailed spread.
15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So let's see what we're going to get.
16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But chatGPT doesn't just generate images in this case.
17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Sorry, it doesn't generate text, it also generates an image.
18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And that is something that really expands the power of what it can do on your behalf in terms of carrying out your intent.
19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And I'll point out this is all live demo.
20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is all generated by the AI as we speak.
21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I actually don't even know what we're going to see.
22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This looks wonderful.
23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now I'm getting hungry just looking at it.
24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now we've extended chatGPT with other tools too.
25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
For example, memory, you can say, save this for later.
26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And the interesting thing about these tools is they're very inspectable.
27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So you get this little pop-up here that says use the dolly app.
28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And by the way, this is coming to all chatGPT users over upcoming months.
29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And you can look under the hood and see that what it actually did was right-of-prompt, just like a human could.
30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And so you sort of have this ability to inspect how the machine is using these tools, which allows us to provide feedback to them.
31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Now it's saved for later.
32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And let me show you what it's like to use that information and to integrate with other applications too.
33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You can say, I now make a shopping list for the tasty thing I was suggesting earlier.
34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to make it a little tricky for the AI.
35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And tweet it out for all the Ted viewers out there.
36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So if you do make this wonderful, wonderful meal, I definitely want to know how it tastes.
37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But you can see that chatGPT is selecting all these different tools without me having to tell it explicitly which ones to use in any situation.
38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And this I think shows a new way of thinking about the user interface.
39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Like we are so used to thinking of, well, we have these apps.
40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We cook between them, we copy, paste between them.
41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And usually it's a great experience within an app as long as you kind of know the menus and know all of the options.
42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes, I would like you to.
43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes, please. Always good to be polite.
44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And by having this unified language interface on top of tools, the AI is able to sort of take away all those details from you.
45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So you don't have to be the one who spells out every single sort of little piece of what's supposed to happen.
46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And as I said, this is live demo.
47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So sometimes the unexpected will happen to us.
48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But let's take a look at the Instacart Shopping List while we're at it.
49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And you can see we sent a list of ingredients to Instacart.
50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Here's everything you need.
51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And the thing that's really interesting is that the traditional UI is still very valuable.
52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
If you look at this, you still can click through it and sort of modify the actual quantities.
53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And that's something that I think shows that they're not going away traditional UIs.
54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's just we have a new augmented way to build them.
55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And now we have a tweet that's been drafted for our review, which is also a very important thing.
56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We can click Run. And there we are.
57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We're the manager. We're able to inspect.
58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We're able to change the work of the AI if we want to.
59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And so after this talk, you will be able to access this yourself.
60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And there we go.
61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Cool.
62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So thank you, everyone.
63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So we'll cut back to the slides.
64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Now, the important thing about how we build this.
65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's not just about building these tools.
66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's about teaching the AI how to use them.
67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Like, what do we even want it to do when we ask these very high-level questions?
68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And to do this, we use an old idea.
69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If you go back to Alan Torin's 1950 paper on the Turing test, he says,
70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Look, you'll never program an answer to this.
71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Instead, you can learn it.
72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You can build a machine like a human child and then teach it through feedback.
73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Have a human teacher who provides rewards and punishments as it tries things out and does things that are either good or bad.
74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And this is exactly how we train chat, GPT.
75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a two-step process.
76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
First, we produce what Turing would have called a child machine through an unsupervised learning process.
77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We just show it the whole world, the whole internet, and say, predict what comes next in text you've never seen before.
78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And this process imbues it with all sorts of wonderful skills.
79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
For example, if you're shown a math problem, the only way to actually complete that math problem, say what comes next,
80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
that green line up there, is to actually solve the math problem.
81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But we actually have to do a second step, too, which is to teach the AI what to do with those skills.
82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And for this, we provide feedback.
83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We have the AI try out multiple things, give us multiple suggestions, and then the human rates them.
84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Says this one's better than that one.
85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And this reinforces not just the specific thing that the AI said, but very importantly, the whole process that the AI used to produce that answer.
86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And this allows it to generalize it, allows it to teach to sort of infer your intent and apply it in scenarios that it hasn't seen before, that it hasn't received feedback.
87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Now, sometimes the things we have to teach the AI are not what you'd expect.
88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
For example, when we first showed GPT-4 to Khan Academy, they said, wow, this is so great.
89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We're going to be able to teach students wonderful things.
90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Only one problem, it doesn't double check students math.
91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If there's some bad math in there, it will happily pretend that one plus one equals three and run them with it.
92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So we had to collect some feedback data.
93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
CellCon himself was very kind and offered 20 hours of his own time to provide feedback to the machine alongside our team.
94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And over the course of a couple months, we were able to teach the AI that, hey, you really should push back on humans in this specific kind of scenario.
95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And we've actually made lots and lots of improvements to the models this way.
96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And when you push that thumbs down in chat GPT, that actually is kind of like sending up a bat signal to our team to say, here's an area of weakness where you should gather feedback.
97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And so when you do that, that's one way that we really listen to our users and make sure we're building something that's more useful for everyone.
98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Now, providing high quality feedback is a hard thing.
99
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If you think about asking a kid to clean their room, if all you're doing is inspecting the floor, you don't know if you're just teaching them to stuff all the toys in the closet.
100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This is a nice, deli-generated image, by the way.
101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And the same sort of reasoning applies to AI as we move to harder tasks.
102
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We will have to scale our ability to provide high quality feedback.
103
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But for this, the AI itself is happy to help.
104
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's happy to help us provide even better feedback and to scale our ability to supervise the machine as time goes on.
105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And let me show you what I mean.
106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:55,000
For example, you can ask for a GPD-4 question like this of how much time passed between these two foundational logs on unsupervised learning and learning from human feedback.
107
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And the model says two months passed.
108
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But is it true? These models are not 100% reliable.
109
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm older, they're getting better every time we provide some feedback.
110
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But we can actually use the AI to fact check.
111
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And it can actually check its own work.
112
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can say fact check this for me.
113
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Now in this case, I've actually given the AI new tool.
114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This one is a browsing tool where the model can issue search queries and click into web pages.
115
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And it actually writes out its whole chain of thought as it does it.
116
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It says I'm just going to search for this and it actually does the search.
117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It then finds the publication date into search results.
118
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It then is issuing another search query.
119
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's going to click into the blog post.
120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And all of this you could do.
121
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's a very tedious task.
122
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's not a thing that humans really want to do.
123
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's much more fun to be in the driver's seat, to be in this manager's position,
124
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
where you can if you want, triple check the work.
125
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And outcome citations.
126
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So you can actually go and very easily verify any piece of this whole chain of reasoning.
127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And it actually turns out two months was wrong, two months in one week.
128
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That was correct.
129
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We'll cut back to the slide.
130
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And so, the thing that's so interesting to me about this whole process is that it's this many step collaboration between a human and an AI.
131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Because a human using this fact checking tool is doing it in order to produce data for another AI to become more useful to a human.
132
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And I think this really shows the shape of something that we should expect to be much more common in the future,
133
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
where we have humans and machines kind of very carefully and delicately designed in how they fit into a problem,
134
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and how we want to solve that problem.
135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We make sure that the humans are providing the management, the oversight, the feedback,
136
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and that the machines are operating in a way that's inspectable and trustworthy.
137
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And together we're able to actually even create even more trustworthy machines.
138
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And I think that over time, if we get this process right, we will be able to solve impossible problems.
139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And to give you a sense of just how impossible I'm talking, I think we're going to be able to rethink almost every aspect of how we interact with computers.
140
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
For example, think about spreadsheets.
141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They've been around in some form since, you know, we'll say 40 years ago with VisitCalc.
142
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And I don't think they've really changed that much in that time.
143
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And here is a specific spreadsheet of all the AI papers on the archive for the past 30 years.
144
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
There's about 167,000 of them.
145
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And you can see their data right here.
146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But let me show you the chat GPT take on how to analyze a data set like this.
147
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So we can give chat GPT access to yet another tool.
148
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This one, a Python interpreter. So it's able to run code just like a data scientist would.
149
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And so you can just literally upload a file and ask questions about it.
150
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And very helpfully, you know, it knows the name of the file.
151
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And it's like, oh, this is CSV, a comma separate value file.
152
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll parse it for you.
153
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The only information here is the name of the file, the column names like you saw, and then the actual data.
154
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And from that, it's able to infer what these columns actually mean.
155
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Like that semantic information wasn't in there.
156
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It has to sort of put together its world knowledge of knowing that, oh, yeah, archive is the site that people submit papers.
157
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And therefore, that's what these things are.
158
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And that these are integer values.
159
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And so therefore, it's a number of authors on the paper.
160
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Like all of that, that's work for a human to do.
161
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And AI is happy to help with it.
162
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Now, I don't even know what I want to ask.
163
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So fortunately, you can ask the machine.
164
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Can you make some exploratory graphs?
165
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And once again, this is a super high level instruction with lots of intent behind it.
166
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But I don't even know what I want.
167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And AI kind of has to infer what I might be interested in.
168
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And so it comes up with some good ideas, I think.
169
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So a histogram of the number of authors per paper, time series of papers per year, word cloud of the paper titles.
170
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
All of that, I think, will be pretty interesting to see.
171
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And the great thing is, it can actually do it.
172
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Here we go, a nice bell curve.
173
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You see that three is kind of the most common.
174
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's going to then write a, it's going to make this nice plot of the papers per year.
175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Something crazy is happening in 2023 though.
176
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Looks like we were on an exponential and it dropped off a cliff.
177
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What could be going on there?
178
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And by the way, all of this is Python code you can expect.
179
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And then we'll see the word cloud.
180
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And so you can see all these wonderful things that appear in these titles.
181
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But I'm pretty unhappy about this 2023 thing.
182
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It looks, makes this year look really bad.
183
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Of course, the problem is that the year's not over.
184
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So I'm going to push back on the machine.
185
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So people 13th was the cut off data, I believe.
186
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Can you use that?
187
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Thank you for your projection.
188
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So we'll see.
189
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This is a kind of ambitious one.
190
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So again, I feel like there was more I wanted out of the machine here.
191
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I really wanted it to notice this thing.
192
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Maybe it's a little bit of an overreach for it to have sort of inferred magically that this is what I wanted.
193
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But I inject my intent.
194
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I provide this additional piece of guidance.
195
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And under the hood, the AI is just writing code again.
196
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So if you want to inspect what it's doing, it's very possible.
197
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And now it does the correct projection.
198
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
If you notice, it even updates the title.
199
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I didn't ask for that, but it knows what I want.
200
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Now, we'll go back to the slide again.
201
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This slide shows a parable of how I think we, you know,
202
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
a vision of how we may end up using this technology in the future.
203
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
A person brought his very sick dog to the vet who, and the veterinary made a bad call to say,
204
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
let's just wait and see.
205
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And the dog would not be here today had he listened.
206
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
In the meanwhile, he provided the blood test, like the full medical records, to GPT-4,
207
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
which said, I am not a vet.
208
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You need to talk to professional.
209
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Here are some hypotheses.
210
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He brought that information to a second vet who used it to save the dog's life.
211
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Now, these systems, they're not perfect.
212
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You cannot overly rely on them.
213
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But this story, I think, shows that the human with a medical professional
214
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and with chat GPT as a brainstorming partner was able to achieve an outcome that would not have happened otherwise.
215
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I think this is something we should all reflect on, think about as we consider how to integrate these systems into our world.
216
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And one thing I believe really deeply is that getting AI right is going to require participation from everyone.
217
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And that's for deciding how we want it to slot in.
218
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's for setting the rules of the road for what an AI will and won't do.
219
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And if there's one thing to take away from this talk, it's that this technology just looks different,
220
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
just different from anything people had anticipated.
221
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And so we all have to become literate.
222
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And that's honestly one of the reasons we release chat GPT.
223
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Together, I believe that we can achieve the Open AI mission of ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.
224
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Thank you.
225
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Thank you.
226
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Greg, wow.
227
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I mean, I suspect that within every mind out here,
228
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
apart from there's a feeling of reeling, I suspect that a very large number of people viewing this,
229
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
you look at that and you think, oh my goodness, pretty much every single thing about the way I work, I need to rethink.
230
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
There's just new possibilities there.
231
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm right, who thinks that they're having to rethink the way that we do things?
232
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah, I mean, it's amazing.
233
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But it's also really scary.
234
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So let's talk, Greg. Let's talk.
235
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Absolutely.
236
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
My first question actually is just how the hell have you done this?
237
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Open AI has a few hundred employees.
238
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Google has thousands of employees working on artificial intelligence.
239
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Why is it you who's come up with this technology that shut the world?
240
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah, I mean, the truth is we're all building on shoulders of giants, right?
241
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
There's no question if you'll get the compute progress, the algorithm that progress, the data progress.
242
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
All of those are really, really industry-wide.
243
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But I think within Open AI we made a lot of very deliberate choices from the early days.
244
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And the first one was just to confront reality as it lays.
245
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And you know, that we just sort of like thought really hard about what is it going to take to make progress here?
246
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
We tried a lot of things that didn't work.
247
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So you only see the things that did.
248
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And I think that the most important thing has been to get teams of people who are very different from each other to work together harmoniously.
249
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Can we have the water by the way?
250
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I just brought here, I think we're going to need it.
251
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So try it, try it.
252
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But isn't there something also?
253
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Just about the fact that you saw something in these language models that meant that if you continue to invest in them and grow them,
254
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
that something at some point might emerge.
255
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes.
256
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And I think that, honestly, I think the story there is pretty illustrative.
257
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I think that at a high level deep learning, we always knew that was what we wanted to be.
258
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It was a deep learning lab.
259
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And exactly how to do it.
260
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I think that in the early days we didn't know.
261
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
We tried a lot of things.
262
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And one person was working on training a model to predict the next character in Amazon reviews.
263
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And he got a result where this is a syntactic process.
264
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You expect you know the model will predict where the commas go, where the nouns and verbs are.
265
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But he actually got a state of the art sentiment analysis classifier out of it.
266
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
This model could tell you if a review was positive or negative.
267
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And today we are just like, come on, anyone could do that.
268
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But this was the first time that you saw this emergence, this sort of semantics that emerged from this underlying syntactic process.
269
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And there we knew you got to scale this thing, you got to see where it goes.
270
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So I think this helps explain the riddle that baffles everyone looking at this.
271
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Because these things are described as prediction machines.
272
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And yet what we're seeing out of them feels, it just feels impossible that that could come from a prediction machine.
273
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Just the stuff you showed us just now.
274
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And the key idea of emergence is that when you get more of a thing, suddenly different things emerge.
275
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It happens all the time.
276
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Ant colonies, single ants run around.
277
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
When you bring enough of them together, you get these ant colonies that have shown completely emergent and different behavior.
278
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Or a city where a few houses together, it's just houses together.
279
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But as you grow the number of houses, things emerge like suburbs and cultural centers and traffic jams.
280
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Give me one moment for you when you saw something pop that just blew your mind that you just did not see coming.
281
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah, well, so if you can try this in the chapter if you add 40 digit numbers.
282
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
40 digit numbers, the model will do it.
283
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Which means it's really learned a internal circuit for how to do it.
284
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And the really interesting thing is actually if you have an ad like a 40 digit number plus a 35 digit number, it'll often get it wrong.
285
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And so you can see that it's really learning the process, but it hasn't fully generalized.
286
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's like you can't memorize the 40 digit edition table.
287
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That's more atoms that are in the universe.
288
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So it had to have learned something general.
289
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But that it hasn't really fully yet learned that, oh, I can like generalize this to adding arbitrary numbers of arbitrary lengths.
290
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So what's happened here is that you've allowed it to scale up and look at an incredible number of pieces of text.
291
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And it is learning things that you didn't know that it was going to be capable of learning.
292
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Well, yeah, it's more nuanced too, because so one science that we're starting to really get good at is predicting some of these emergent capabilities.
293
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And to do that actually, one of the things I think is very under song in this field is sort of engineering quality.
294
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Like we had to rebuild our entire stack and get, you know, like when you think about building a rocket, like you know every tolerance has to be like incredibly tiny.
295
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Same is true in machine learning. You have to get every single piece of the stack engineered properly.
296
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And then you can start doing these predictions.
297
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
There are all these incredibly smooth scale on curves.
298
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I think tell you something deeply fundamental about intelligence.
299
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You do look at our GPT-4 blog post. You can see all of these curves in there.
300
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And now we're starting to be able to predict.
301
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So we were able to predict, for example, the performance on coding problems.
302
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
From, you know, we basically look at some models that are 10,000 times or a thousand times smaller.
303
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And so there's something about this that is actually smooth scaling even though it's still early days.
304
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So here is one of the big fears then that arises from this.
305
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:56,000
If it's fundamental to what's happening here, that as you scale up, things emerge that you can't, you can maybe predict in some level of confidence.
306
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But they still, it's capable of surprising you.
307
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why isn't there just a huge risk of something truly terrible emerging?
308
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, I think all these are questions of degree and scale and timing.
309
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And I think one thing people miss too is sort of the integration with the world is also this like incredibly emergent,
310
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
like sort of very powerful thing too.
311
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And so that's one of the reasons that we think it's so important to deploy incrementally.
312
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And so I think that what we kind of see right now, if you look at this talk, a lot of what I focus on,
313
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
is providing really high quality feedback.
314
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Today the tasks that we do, you can inspect them, right?
315
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's very easy to look at that math problem and be like, no, no, no, machine like seven with the correct answer.
316
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But even summarizing a book, like that's a hard thing to supervise.
317
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Like how do you know if this book summary is any good? You have to read the whole book.
318
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
No one wants to do that.
319
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And so I think that the important thing will be that we take this step by step and that we say, okay, as we move on to book summaries,
320
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
we have to supervise this task properly. We have to build up a track record with these machines that they're able to actually carry out our intent.
321
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And I think we're going to have to produce even better, more efficient, sort of more reliable ways of scaling this sort of like making the machine be aligned with you.
322
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So we're going to hear a lecture in the session. There are critics who say that, you know, there's no real understanding inside the system.
323
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Is it going to always, we're never going to know that it's not generating errors, that it doesn't have common sense and so forth.
324
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Is it your belief, Greg, that that is true at any one moment, but that the expansion of the scale and the human feedback, you know, that you talked about is basically going to
325
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
take it on that journey of actually getting to things like truth and wisdom and so forth with a high degree of confidence.
326
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah, well, I think that the open AI, I mean, the story I'm sure it's yes, I believe that is where we're headed on.
327
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And I think that the open AI approach here has always been just like let reality hit you in the face, right?
328
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's like this field is the field of broken promises of all these experts saying, X is going to happen, why is how it works.
329
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
People have been saying, you're on that's aren't going to work for 70 years. They haven't been right yet.
330
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
They might be right, you know, maybe 70 years plus one or something like that is what you need.
331
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:15,000
But I think that our approach has always been you've got to push to the limits of this technology to really see it in action because that tells you then, oh, here's how we can move on to a new paradigm.
332
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And we just haven't exhausted the fruit here.
333
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I mean, it's quite a controversial stance you've taken that the right way to do this is to put it out there in public and then harness all this, you know, instead of just your team giving feedback.
334
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The world is now giving feedback. But if you know bad things are going to emerge, it is out there.
335
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So, you know, the original story that I heard on open AI when you were founded as a nonprofit where you were there as the great sort of check on the big companies doing their unknown possibly evil thing with AI.
336
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And you were going to you were going to build models that sort of, you know, somehow held them accountable and could was capable of slowing the feel down if need be already.
337
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That's kind of what I had and yet what's happened arguably is the opposite that you that your release of GPT, especially chap, GPT put some shock waves through the tech world that now Google and meta and so forth.
338
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And so, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
339
00:25:46,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But you in a systematic estate business, you know, you know, you know, you know, ήταν right, you know, you know, you know, you know, you knew that you had
340
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
before they are super powerful, that you actually have the ability to see them in action.
341
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And we've seen it from GPT-3, right? GPT-3, we really were afraid that the number one thing people were going to do with it was generate misinformation, try to tip elections.
342
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Instead, the number one thing was generating Viagras Bam.
343
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So Viagras Bam is bad, but there are things that are much worse. If here's a thought experiment for you.
344
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Suppose you're sitting around, there's a box on the table.
345
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You believe that in that box is something that there's a very strong chance, it's something absolutely glorious.
346
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's going to give beautiful gifts to your family and to everyone.
347
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But there's actually also a 1% thing in the small print there that says Pandora.
348
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And there's a chance that this actually could unleash unimaginable evils on the world.
349
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Do you open that box?
350
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Well, so absolutely not. I think you don't do it that way.
351
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And honestly, I'll tell you a story that I haven't actually told before, which is that after we started opening AI, I remember I was in Puerto Rico for an AI conference.
352
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I was sitting in the hotel room just looking out over this wonderful water, all these people having good time.
353
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And you think about it for a moment. If you could choose for a potentially, basically, that Pandora's box, to be five years away or five hundred years away.
354
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Which would you pick? Right? And on the one hand, you're like, well, maybe for you personally, it's better to have it be five years away.
355
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But if it gets to be five hundred years away, and people get more time to get it right, which do you pick?
356
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And I just really felt it in that moment. I was like, of course you do the five hundred years. For real, there's many people, my brother is in the military at the time.
357
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And he puts his life on the line in a much more real way than any of us typing things in computers and developing this technology at the time.
358
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And so, yeah, like I'm really sold on the, you got to approach this right. But I don't think that's quite playing the field as it truly lies.
359
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Like if you look at the whole history of computing, like that, that I really mean it when I say that this is a industry wide, or even like sort of just almost like a human development of technology wide shift.
360
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And the more that you sort of don't put together the pieces that are there, right? We're still making faster computers. We're still improving the algorithms, like all these things they are happening.
361
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And if you don't put them together, you get an overhang, which means that if someone does, or you know that the moment that someone does manage to connect the circuit, then you suddenly have this very powerful thing.
362
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:54,000
No one said any time to adjust, like who knows what kind of safety precautions you get. And so I think that one thing I take away is like even you think about development of other sort of technology,
363
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
think about nuclear weapons, people talk about being like a zero to one sort of like, you know, sort of change in what humans could do.
364
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But I actually think that if you look at capability, it's been quite smooth over time. And so the history I think of every technology we've developed has been you got to do it incrementally, and you got to figure out how to manage it for each moment that you're doing.
365
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So what I'm hearing is that you, that the model you want us to have is that we have birthed this extraordinary child that may have superpowers that take humanity to a whole new place.
366
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It is our collective responsibility to provide the guardrails for this child, to collectively teach it to be wise and not to terrace all or down. Is that basically the model?
367
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I think it's true. And I think it's also important to say this may shift, right? Like we got to take each step as we encounter it. And I think it's incredibly important today that we all do get glitter in this technology, figure out how to provide the feedback, decide what we want from it.
368
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And I think that my hope is that that will be continued to be the best path, but it's so good we're honestly having this debate because we wouldn't otherwise if it weren't out there.
369
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Great Brockman, thank you so much for coming to Ted and blowing our minds. Thank you.
